# World Weather Analysis

## Background

This project utilizes Python requests, Matplotlib, OpenWeatherMap APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?" 

## WeatherPy Graphs

Final plots showing the following relationships are found in the Images folder:

* Temperature vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

### Technology Used:
* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* Matplotlib
* OpenWeatherMap API
